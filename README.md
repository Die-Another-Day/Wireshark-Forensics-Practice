# Wireshark-Forensics-Practice
“A collection of 5 network forensic labs analyzing PCAPs for MitM attacks, data exfiltration, and compromised Windows hosts using Wireshark and TCPDump.”

#🎯 Key Scenarios Analyzed
Network Fundamentals: Identifying top talkers and DNS query patterns.

Windows Compromise: Tracking an attacker through a remote shell on port 8081.

Man-in-the-Middle: Detecting ARP poisoning and intercepting exfiltrated employee data.

Traffic Volumetrics: Quantifying TCP SYN-ACK handshakes and identifying Chrome versions.

Web & Service Forensics: Inspecting OpenSSH banners and recovering proprietary assets.
